# @fantastic-dev/convex-tinybird

A Convex component for shipping analytics events to [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co). The
intended shape: a host mutation enqueues an event in the same transaction as its own writes, and
the component delivers it at least once, deduped by the event's identity. Project-agnostic by
construction: it depends on `convex` only (and `@convex-dev/workpool` once delivery lands), never
on the host's schema or auth.

## Status

This package is being built in layers, and this README describes only what is actually present.

- **Implemented:** component mount and declared configuration, the `events`/`settings` schema, the
  public contract types and validators, and the `health` query.
- **Not implemented yet:** enqueue, delivery to the Events API, retries, pausing, replay and
  retention. Calling anything beyond `health` will not compile.

Until delivery exists the component is inert by design: with no `TINYBIRD_TOKEN` it schedules
nothing and makes no outbound request.

Design and conventions: [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md) — state machine, transaction
boundaries, dedupe window, scheduling ownership. `node scripts/check-boundary.mjs` proves the package
imports nothing from the host. The full consumer guide lands with the example app.
