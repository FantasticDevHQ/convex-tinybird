# Architecture

The design in prose. The Linear project document "Architecture and conventions" is the planning
source; this file is what ships with the package and must stay true to the code next to it.

## What the component does

A host mutation calls `enqueue` with a datasource name, an event identity and a JSON payload. The
event row is written in the same Convex transaction as the host's own writes, so the two commit
or roll back together. Delivery to the Tinybird Events API happens afterwards, asynchronously,
through a nested Workpool, at least once. Tinybird is expected to dedupe by `event_id`
(a `ReplacingMergeTree` keyed on it); the component never claims exactly-once delivery.

## State machine

```
enqueue ──▶ pending ──(Workpool action)──▶ delivering ──▶ delivered
                ▲                              │
                │ transient failure (Workpool retry)   │ terminal failure / retries exhausted
                └──────────────────────────────┴──▶ failed ──(replayFailed)──▶ pending
paused destination: actions defer and events stay pending; 401/403 or an invalid host pauses it
stuck: delivering older than a threshold ──(requeueStuck)──▶ pending
```

States live on the `events` row (`pending | delivering | delivered | failed`); destination-wide
state (`paused`, last error, last operator action) lives on the single `settings` row.

## Transaction boundaries

| Boundary                                                                     | Runs in                                                                   | Commits with                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `enqueue`                                                                    | the host's mutation (component mutation called through `ctx.runMutation`) | the host's writes                      |
| `deliverEvent`                                                               | a Workpool action (default runtime, raw `fetch`)                          | nothing: actions are not transactional |
| `markDelivering` / `markDelivered` / `markFailed`                            | component mutations called by the action                                  | themselves only                        |
| operator mutations (`pause`, `resume`, `replay*`, `cleanup`, `requeueStuck`) | host-authorized wrappers                                                  | themselves only                        |

A crash between `markDelivering` and the acknowledgement leaves a `delivering` row; `requeueStuck`
returns it to `pending` and it is re-sent. That is the at-least-once path.

## Identity, duplicates and the replay horizon

Identity is `(datasource, eventId)`, unique per mounted instance through the `by_identity`
index. The payload is canonicalised (sorted keys, no whitespace) before it is stored or compared.
Same identity and equal canonical payload → `duplicate`, the existing row is returned; different
payload → `identity_conflict`. There is no separate receipt table: the event row is the receipt.

`cleanup` deletes `delivered` rows after their retention (default 7 days) and `failed` rows after
a longer one (default 30 days); it never deletes `pending` or `delivering` rows. After a delivered
row is gone the same identity is accepted again, so **the dedupe window equals the delivered
retention window**. Replaying dead letters keeps the original identity and payload.

## Configuration and credentials

`TINYBIRD_TOKEN` and `TINYBIRD_HOST` are declared on `defineComponent` and supplied by the host in
`app.use(tinybird, { env })`. Component code reads them only through the generated `env` export.
They are never stored, returned or logged. Without a token the component is _unconfigured_:
enqueue still stores events, nothing is scheduled and no request leaves the deployment.
Per-instance behaviour (payload bound, request timeout, retry policy) is configured on the
`TinybirdDelivery` client and validated eagerly; unknown option keys are rejected.

Named instances are separate mounts (`app.use(tinybird, { name })`), each with its own tables, so
instance isolation needs no code.

## Retries and dead letters

A response is one of three things: delivered, terminally failed, or worth another attempt.
Terminal means the row will never be accepted as it stands (`400`, `404`, `413`, `422`, or rows
Tinybird quarantined); those never retry. Everything else retries, including an accepted status
whose row counts cannot be read, because that is the only reading that neither loses the event
nor dead-letters one that actually arrived.

Each failed attempt is recorded and the event returns to `pending`, so the next attempt can claim
it. When the budget runs out the pool reports the failure and the event becomes a dead letter with
category `exhausted`. Because `exhausted` says only that the attempts finished, each event keeps a
bounded history of its earlier failures; that is where the actual reason lives.

Defaults are eight attempts with exponential backoff from one second, roughly four minutes before
an event dead-letters. A host can override them per instance on the client or per call at enqueue,
and both are validated against the same bounds.

**`Retry-After` is deliberately not implemented.** Tinybird sends it on `429`, and honouring it
would mean scheduling the next attempt ourselves, which is exactly the ownership the nested pool
holds. The pool's backoff is used instead. This is a real limitation: under a sustained rate limit
the backoff may be shorter than the server asked for. Revisit it if rate limiting is observed in
practice rather than in theory.

## Scheduling ownership

- The nested `@convex-dev/workpool` owns delivery retries, backoff and attempt budgets. Nothing
  else in the component calls `ctx.scheduler`.
- The host owns the maintenance cron (`requeueStuck`, then `cleanup`, both bounded) with its own
  cron mechanism. The component ships no cron.
- Tinybird owns aggregation. There are no Convex-side rollups.

## Boundary and the standalone package path

`scripts/check-boundary.mjs` rejects any `@fantastic-dev/*`, `packages/backend`, Better Auth or
package-escaping import under `src/` and any runtime dependency outside `convex` and
`@convex-dev/workpool`. The package is built inside the Fantastic.dev monorepo as a workspace
package and is meant to move to its own repository and npm once the first consumer is verified;
because it never depended on the host, that move is a packaging change, not a migration.
